## How to install/uninstall: MSI version

Run the MSI installer and follow its instructions to install.  
Uninstallation is also performed using standard OS methods.

Even after uninstallation, configuration files and profiles will remain in "NeeLaboratory/NeeRuler" in My Documents, so please delete them manually.
